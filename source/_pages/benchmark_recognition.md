### Cross-Sensory Retrieval

Cross-sensory retrieval requires the model to take one sensory modality as input and retrieve the corresponding data of another modality. For instance, given the sound of striking a mug, the “audio2vision” model needs to retrieve the corresponding image of the mug from a pool of images of hundreds of objects. In this benchmark, each sensory modality (vision, audio, touch) can be used as either input or output, leading to 9 sub-tasks.
